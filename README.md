I have used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to construct a dynamic project. On the homepage of this project, there is a rectangle that reacts to human input. The rectangle instantly changes colour when the mouse pointer is inside of it. This captivating feature makes the webpage more visually appealing and interactive, which increases user engagement. This compelling effect is made possible by the mix of HTML for content organisation, CSS for style, and JavaScript for interaction, which improves the user experience overall. This project demonstrates how web development tools may be used to produce aesthetically pleasing and compelling user interfaces.
